                  At AM Pure Services, we prioritize air duct cleaning because
                  it is a major determinant of indoor air quality. We understand
                  how important your indoor air comfort is to you and your
                  family and we always strive to deliver exactly that in our
                  professional cleaning. Working with our certified techs means
                  working with a team that understands all your heating and

                  In summer, you expect your air conditioner to produce a
                  pleasant stay indoors. However, it cannot maintain such
                  standards if it is not in tip-top shape. To refresh you
                  enough, your cooling system must perform optimally and
                  efficiently throughout the uncomfortably hot season.

                  Similarly, your furnace is no good if it cannot warm your home
                  enough to enhance your indoor air comfort during the harshness
                  of winter. If the furnace is heating the house less
                  effectively than it should, then you are getting a poor return
                  on your HVAC investment.

                  To maintain a clean and healthy home environment, your HVAC

                  It is not uncommon for your system’s air ducts and filters to
                  collect dust, odor, or have a dust mite infestation after
                  running for a while. This may result in clogged air filters

                  Operating a clogged system is also hazardous because you end

                  This then defeats the whole purpose of having an HVAC system
                  in the first place and begs the question, “Would you be

                  Although answering the “how” requires a detailed explanation,

                  approach:
                </span>
                <br></br>

                  1. Using a screwdriver, unfasten your floor or wall register

                <br></br>

                  You should know that air duct cleaning takes a lot more than
                  merely blowing out the vents inside your home. The task is
                  more complicated than it looks or sounds because the vents are
                  only a part of your home’s entire duct system. In its
                  entirety, the system comprises the following components:
                </span>
                <br></br>
                <span>• Return vents</span>

                  So, why is it necessary to clean your home’s ducts? Duct
                  cleaning is necessary because the ducts collect dust after a
                  while. The accumulated dust then results in musty smells,
                  increased dusting frequency, and poor heating and cooling
                  performance.
                </span>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span>
                  Although repetitive dust cycling is a normal occurrence inside
                  your home, it can intensify the need for air duct cleaning.
                  Other factors that may hasten the need to clean and add to its
                  frequency include:
                </span>
                <br></br>
                <span>• Pets</span>
                <br></br>
                <span>• Occupants with allergies or asthma</span>

                <span>
                  Without your HVAC system, climate control inside your home is
                  impossible. Without proper climate control, you cannot
                  guarantee the quality of indoor air for your family, friends,
                  guests, and pets. To turn your house into a livable space,
                  that is a situation you want to avoid at all costs.

                <br></br>
                <span>
                  It helps to note that the same dirt, pollen, and contaminants
                  landing on your carpet can equally collect and circulate
                  inside your HVAC system. As polluted air builds up gradually,
                  your heating and cooling system becomes dirty. Ultimately,
                  this ends up compromising your home’s indoor air quality.

                <span>
                  According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), poor
                  indoor air quality should urgently concern you. It is among
                  the leading causes of health issues such as:
                </span>
                <br></br>
                <span>• Heart diseases</span>
                <br></br>
                <span>• Cancer</span>
                <br></br>
                <span>• Respiratory diseases</span>
                <br></br>
                <span>• Headaches, fatigue, and dizziness</span>
                <br></br>
                <span>• Eye, nose, and throat irritation</span>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span>
                  Moreover, dirt accumulation on your heating or cooling coils
                  reduces the operating efficiency of your HVAC unit. The
                  gravity of the problem thereby makes air duct cleaning one of
                  the most essential cleaning services in any home.

                Why clean your air ducts?

                  Among other benefits, air duct cleaning always enhances your
                  home’s indoor air quality. In fact, homeowners battling
                  allergy problems report a significant reduction in symptoms as
                  soon as their HVAC units undergo a thorough professional
                  cleaning. Moreover, proper air duct cleaning works to
                  eliminate disconcerting odors resulting from pets or smokers
                  inside the house.
                </span>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span>
                  Still on the benefits, regular air duct cleaning reduces dust
                  saturation in your indoor air significantly. Despite the
                  integration of filters in heating and cooling systems, they
                  don’t always deliver 100% efficiency. Some dust still falls
                  through the cracks, penetrates the system, and settles inside
                  the air ducts.
                </span>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span>
                  A thorough duct cleaning is essential because it yields a
                  noticeable difference in the overall dust distribution inside
                  your home.
                </span>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span>
                  Beyond dust reduction and enhancement of indoor air quality, a
                  professional duct cleaning process can also result in
                  significant financial benefits.

                  This is because with clean air ducts, the system doesn’t
                  strain to push air through the vents. Less you spend on
                  electricity and the maintenance of your HVAC unit.
